## 📝 Project Overview
In the competitive landscape of retail banking, sales teams often struggle with "cold calling" fatigue, wasting significant resources on leads with low conversion potential. Drawing from my **10 years of professional experience in the banking sector**, I developed the **Smart Bank Lead Scorer**. 

This end-to-end Machine Learning application transforms raw customer data into actionable insights, allowing sales professionals to prioritize high-value prospects through data-driven precision rather than intuition.



## 🚀 Key Features
* **Predictive Scoring:** Estimates the probability of a customer subscribing to a term deposit.
* **Domain-Driven Logic:** Integrated custom "boosting" weights based on real-world banking experience (e.g., job stability and debt-free status).
* **Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly Streamlit interface for real-time lead evaluation.
* **Categorized Priority:** Automatically labels leads as **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** priority for immediate action.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.13
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Joblib
* **Web Framework:** Streamlit
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 📊 How it Works
The model analyzes several key customer attributes:
1.  **Demographics:** Age, Job, Education.
2.  **Financial Status:** Housing and Personal Loan history.
3.  **Marketing Insights:** Previous campaign outcomes and contact frequency.
